# Link

> css

The Link component enables client-side navigation between two pages in the same Next.js app.

Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JavaScript, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser.

Here’s a simple way you can verify:

1. Use the browser’s developer tools to change the background CSS property of `<html>` to yellow.

2. Click on the links to go back and forth between the two pages.

3. You’ll see that the yellow background persists between page transitions.

This shows that the browser does not load the full page and client-side navigation is working.


If you’ve used `<a href="…">` instead of `<Link href="…">` and did this, the background color will be cleared on link clicks because the browser does the full refresh.

Furthermore, in a production build of Next.js, whenever Link components appear in the browser’s viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked page in the background. By the time you click the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and the page transition will be near-instant!
